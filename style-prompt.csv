concept,concept-label,0,1
curvature,rectilinear(0)~curvilinear(1),"A building with a distinctly rectilinear shape and linear design elements. The structure is composed entirely of straight lines and angular shapes, creating a geometric appearance. All visible edges and corners of the building form right angles, emphasizing a grid-like organization in its overall composition.","A building with completely curvilinear forms and highly flowing lines. The structure features very wavy shapes and smooth, rounded contours throughout its design. There are no straight edges or sharp angles visible in the main architectural elements. The overall form of the building appears organic and fluid."
saturation,achromatic(0)~chromatic(1),"A color photograph of a building rendered purely in grayscale tones. The structure appears in black, white, and shades of gray, with no visible chromatic colors. The building's form and details are articulated solely through variations in lightness and darkness, creating a monochromatic aesthetic.","A color photograph of a building showcasing vivid and highly saturated hues. The structure appears very colorful, with intense and rich colors used across its exterior surfaces. The building's color scheme creates strong visual contrast and vibrancy, making it stand out prominently in its surroundings."
transparency,opaque(0)~transparent(1),"A solid and opaque building with an enclosed structure. The edifice appears impenetrable to light, with no see-through elements visible on its main surfaces. The building's exterior is composed of non-transparent materials, creating a clear separation between interior and exterior spaces.","A building featuring a glazed facade and transparent edifice. The structure has a see-through quality, with extensive use of glass walls or large windows. The transparent walls may be supported by visible pillars or frames. The interior spaces or the structure behind the glass is partially visible from the exterior view."
symmetry,asymmetric(0)~symmetric(1),"A building with an asymmetrical design and unbalanced structure. The edifice features an irregular shape and composition, with visibly different arrangements of elements on its various sides or facades. The overall form lacks a clear central axis of symmetry, instead showcasing a dynamic and varied architectural expression.	","A building exhibiting perfect symmetry in its design. The structure features mirrored halves when divided vertically down the center. All visible elements, including overall form and architectural details, are precisely balanced and repeated on both sides of a central axis, creating a harmonious and ordered appearance."
